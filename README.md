****🏦 Bank Management System (C++ Console Application)****
**📖 About the Project**

This project is a simple yet powerful bank management system built using C++.
It allows administrators and users to manage clients, perform banking transactions, and control user access permissions using plain text files for data storage.

The system mimics the core operations of a real banking system — including client registration, deposits, withdrawals, user management, and secure login — all within a console-based interface.
